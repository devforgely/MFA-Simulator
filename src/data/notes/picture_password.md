### Picture Password

The Picture Password authentication mechanism has two distinct parts: the initial password enrollment and subsequent password verification.  During enrollment, a user selects a theme identifying the thumbnail photos to be applied and then registers a sequence of thumbnail images that are used to derive the associated password.  When the device is powered on or booted up, the user must enter the currently enrolled image sequence for verification to gain access to the device.  After a successful authentication, the user may change the password, selecting a new sequence and/or theme.

Picture Password offers benefits over PINs and textual passwords, especially for the visually inclined user.  As with textual passwords, a similar password length and alphabet size is used. However, instead of having to memorize and enter a string of random-like alphanumeric 
characters, a sequence of thumbnail images must be selected and retained.  Experimental results suggest that human visual memory is well suited to such visual and cognitive tasks. The underlying mechanism, which handles random 3 character code assignment to images, password composition, enrollment, and verification, is completely hidden from the user.
